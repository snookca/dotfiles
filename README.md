# dotfiles
Snook's dotfiles. aka Snotfiles

This repo is currently a work in progress as I figure out what works and doesn't work for my personal setup

## To-do:
* Install script for new system
  * install homebrew
  * brew install ruby
  * brew install sass/sass/sass (or should I use standalone install?)
  * install macvim
  * install node
  * Dank Mono
  * set up command prompt to recognize git repo
  * set up bash git autocomplete

* set up vim colour scheme for readonly files

## New System checklist
* set up ssh key for github [instructions](https://help.github.com/articles/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent/)

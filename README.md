# dotfiles
Snook's dotfiles. aka Snotfiles

This repo is currently a work in progress as I figure out what works and doesn't work for my personal setup

## To-do:
* automate macvim install
* automate node install
* Dank Mono? (I probably shouldn't put the font files in a public repo)
* set up vim colour scheme for readonly files

## New System checklist
* set up ssh key for github [instructions](https://help.github.com/articles/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent/)

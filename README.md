# dotfiles
Snook's dotfiles. aka Snotfiles

This repo is currently a work in progress as I figure out what works and doesn't work for my personal setup

## To-do:
* Install script for new system
  * set up simlinks
  * install homebrew
  * brew install ruby
  * brew install sass/sass/sass (or should I use standalone install?)
  * install macvim
  * install node
  * Dank Mono
  * set up command prompt to recognize git repo
  * set up bash git autocomplete
  * system prefs?
* .vim and .vimrc
  * set up vim colour scheme for readonly files
* .bash_profile
